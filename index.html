          It's Christmas time and a ghetto Santa Claus breaks into their run-down apartment, stealing all their presents, along 
          with anything else he can stuff into his sack, including the rent money hidden in their stereo speakers. 
          Their only hope to not get evicted before Christmas is to take jobs as security guards at a local mall, where they
          learn some comic lessons about the true meaning of the holidays.</td>

          As punishment, they are forced to escort a pair of socialites (Anne Dudek, Rochelle Aytes) to the Hamptons, where
          they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper. But when the girls realize the FBI's plan, they refuse to go. 
          Left without options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose as the sisters, transforming themselves from African-American 
          men into a pair of blonde, white women.

           Worse, Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), the evil principal at Matilda's school, is a terrifyingly strict bully.
            However, when Matilda realizes she has the power of telekinesis, she begins to defend her friends from Trunchbull's

          introduces him to a bizarrely comic crime underworld. Luckily, Ashtray falls for urban poet Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones), and she 
          convinces him to go straight -- but he must deal with her manic ex-boyfriend Toothpick (Darrel Heath).</td>
